# Harness progress

The memory between long-running sessions, together with `git log`. Newest entry first: each session adds one at the top of **Sessions** before it commits. See `CLAUDE.md` for the routine.

## Sessions

### 2026-11-11 · setup · Harness set up

- **Did:** Added the long-running harness: `harness/` (feature list, this log, `init.sh`, `status.sh`, `run.sh`), the `/harness-plan` and `/harness-work` commands, the `feature-verifier` agent, and a Playwright smoke test of the core flow against the fake claude.ai (`npm run e2e`).
- **Verified:** `harness/init.sh` passes: typecheck, lint, format, unit tests, e2e smoke.
- **State:** No goal yet; the feature list is empty.
- **Next:** Run `/harness-plan <goal>` to turn a goal into features.
