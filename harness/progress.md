# Harness progress

The memory between long-running sessions, together with `git log`. Newest entry first: each session adds one at the top of **Sessions** before it commits. See `CLAUDE.md` for the routine.

## Sessions

### 2026-11-11 · plan · Share UX fixes

- **Did:** Planned the goal on `harness/share-ux-fixes`: fix + Current tab for `claude.ai/cowork/{session}?artifact={uuid}` links, make list names optional (named after their addresses) with required fields marked `*`, add a copy button beside artifact links, and make starting a new share after a run obvious. 18 features (F001–F018), all `passes: false`.
- **Verified:** `harness/init.sh` passes on the new branch: typecheck, lint, format, unit tests, e2e smoke.
- **State:** Nothing built yet.
- **Next:** `/harness-work` takes F001.
- **Notes:**
  - **Cowork bug:** `parseArtifactRef()` in `src/core/artifactUrl.ts` only reads `?artifact=` on `chat/` paths, so cowork links return null. Accept `cowork/` too (keep rejecting `project/`, which a unit test pins). Whether a cowork artifact's uuid works with `/api/frame/...` like a chat one is unchecked: the fake can't tell. A human should Preview (read-only) a real cowork artifact before release.
  - **Current tab in e2e:** the panel is a normal tab, and `currentTabArtifact()` queries the active tab. Serve the claude.ai page with `context.route` (nothing must reach claude.ai), bring it to the front, then drive the panel page; Playwright clicks don't activate a tab.
  - **Automatic list name** (decision): first two addresses after de-duplication, in entered order. 1 → `a`, 2 → `a & b`, more → `a & b +N emails` (`+1 email` singular). On a clash append ` (2)`, ` (3)`… Store it as the list's name: the config schema doesn't change. Put the naming logic in `src/core/` with unit tests.
  - **Required markers:** `*` on Email addresses (list form) and Artifacts (Share tab); the name label becomes `List name (optional)`. `e2e/smoke.spec.ts` uses `getByLabel('List name')` and `getByLabel('Email addresses')`, which still match substrings.
  - **Copy button:** use `navigator.clipboard.writeText` from the panel's click. Don't add the `clipboardWrite` permission: a new permission makes Chrome disable the extension on update until users approve it. In e2e, grant `clipboard-read`/`clipboard-write` to read it back.
  - **New share** (my reading of "confusing"): the finished run's only action is a plain `New share` button among others. F015–F017 rename it `Start a new share`, make it primary and full-width when the run is finished, add a finished message, and keep the confirmation only for a stopped run with invites left. Ask the user if they meant something else.

### 2026-11-11 · setup · Harness set up

- **Did:** Added the long-running harness: `harness/` (feature list, this log, `init.sh`, `status.sh`, `run.sh`), the `/harness-plan` and `/harness-work` commands, the `feature-verifier` agent, and a Playwright smoke test of the core flow against the fake claude.ai (`npm run e2e`).
- **Verified:** `harness/init.sh` passes: typecheck, lint, format, unit tests, e2e smoke.
- **State:** No goal yet; the feature list is empty.
- **Next:** Run `/harness-plan <goal>` to turn a goal into features.
